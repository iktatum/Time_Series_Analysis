# Time_Series_Analysis


 - Based on the p-value .422 as well as higher values (.8) at the lags at 1 and 2, the model suggests that it is not a good model to predict Yen Return Values. The results do not appear to be significant. 

### Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

- The raw data suggest that the trend in the yen price shoudl rise and would warrant a  uy vrecommendation, but in review of the totality of the data, teh reliability of the model does not appear to be there and should not be heavily relied upon.

### Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
- The risk (measured by volatility is expected to increase only slightly, which does mbode well for the possibility that the price wil increase 

### Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
- Based on the model evaluation, I would not suggest using this model to forecast the yen prices. The AIC and BIC measures are very high and the p values ion the ARIMA and GARCH models do not suggest that the models are reliable.

### Regression Analysis
- The in sample MSE was a little higher than the out of sample MSE, which indicates that that there is less error (or variance) in the predicted versus the actual values. The model onl;y slightly loses reliability across the data sets.
